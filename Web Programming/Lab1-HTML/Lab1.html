<div style="background-color:Khaki"><p><b>The River Danube</b>, Europe's second-longest river, rises in Germany's Black Forest and flows in a 
general southeast direction for 2,857 km (1,775 mi), coursing through ten countries before emptying 
into Romania's Danube Delta. The Carpathian Mountains, which cross Romania from the north to the southwest, 
include Moldoveanu Peak, at an altitude of 2,544 m (8,346 ft). </p>

	<h4> Name and etymology </h4>
	<p>Danube is an Old European river name derived from a Proto-Indo-European dānu. 
	Other European river names from the same root include the Dunaj, Dzvina/Daugava, Don, Donets, Dnieper, Dniestr, 
	Dysna and Tana/Deatnu. In Rigvedic Sanskrit, dānu means "fluid, drop", and in Avestan, the same word means "river". 
	In the Rigveda, Dānu once appears as the mother of Vrtra, "a dragon blocking the course of the rivers". 
	The Finnish word for Danube is Tonava, which is most likely derived from the word for the river in German, Donau. 
	Its Sami name Deatnu means "Great River". It is possible that dānu in Scythian as in Avestan was a generic word for 
	"river": Dnieper and Dniestr, from Danapris and Danastius, are presumed to continue Scythian *dānu apara "far river" 
	and dānu nazdya- "near river", respectively.

	<h1> HISTORY </h1>
	<h2> Prehistory </h2>
	<p>  Human remains found in Peștera cu Oase ("Cave with Bones"), radiocarbon dated as being from circa 40,000 years ago, 
	represent the oldest known Homo sapiens in Europe. 
	Neolithic techniques and agriculture spread after the arrival of a mixed group of people from Thessaly in the 
	6th millennium BC. Excavations near a salt spring at Lunca yielded the earliest evidence for salt exploitation in 
	Europe; here the production of salt started between 6050 and 5900 BC. The first permanent settlements also 
	appeared in the Neolithic. Some of them developed into "proto-cities", which were larger than 800 acres 
	(3.2 km2). 
	The Cucuteni–Trypillia culture—the best known archaeological culture of Old Europe—flourished in Muntenia, 
	southeastern Transylvania and northeastern Moldavia in the 3rd millennium BC. The first fortified settlements 
	appeared around 1800 BC, showing the militant character of Bronze Age societies. </p>
